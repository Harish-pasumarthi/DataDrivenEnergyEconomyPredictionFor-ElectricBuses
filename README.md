- **ML Libraries**: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

1. **Multivariate Linear Regression (MLR)**  
   Models the linear relationship between multiple input features and energy usage.

2. **Random Forest Regression (RF)** 🌳  
   An ensemble of decision trees for robust and accurate predictions.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** 📈  
   Utilizes kernels to map data into higher dimensions for better regression performance.

4. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** 🧠  
   Deep learning model that captures complex, non-linear patterns in data.

5. **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)** 📊  
   Probabilistic regression providing high accuracy and uncertainty estimation.
